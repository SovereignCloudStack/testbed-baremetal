==========================================
GAIA-X Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) testbed
==========================================

This testbed provides an infrastructure based on bare-metal systems. It
is used as a basis for CI tests and as a demonstrator.

The testbed is available to the GAIA-X community for testing integrations
etc.

Since the GAIA-X Identity and Trust Management services are currently not
yet available, the testbed can only be used after consultation and
on-boarding.

The testbed is accessible under https://gx-scs.okeanos.dev.
